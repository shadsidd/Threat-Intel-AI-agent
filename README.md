# Threat Intelligence Aggregator

A cyber security threat intelligence AI agent tool that automatically aggregates and summarizes recent data threats across web, Twitter and threat intelligence feeds.

## Overview

This tool leverages the power of AI to provide comprehensive threat intelligence with minimal effort. It uses four specialized AI agents working in concert to deliver actionable security insights from multiple sources, giving you a complete picture of the current threat landscape.

The collected data is combined into a comprehensive threat intelligence report with sections covering threat actors, targeted industries, attack vectors, and TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

## ðŸ¤– AI Agent Team

The tool employs a team of four specialized AI agents, each with its own role:

### 1. Web Search Agent
This agent scours the internet for the latest cybersecurity threat reports, focusing on content from the past 7 days. It uses the EXA search API to find detailed information about emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack patterns across reliable security sources.

### 2. X Analysis Agent
Dedicated to monitoring social media signals, this agent analyzes recent posts on X (formerly Twitter) for mentions of cybersecurity threats. It captures early warnings and real-time discussions among security professionals about emerging threats.

### 3. Feed Reader Agent
This specialist agent focuses on official vulnerability feeds, including the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and US-CERT alerts. It extracts structured data about the latest CVEs, security advisories, and official alerts.

### 4. Summary Agent (Team Leader)
The team leader agent coordinates the other three agents, collects their findings, and synthesizes everything into a coherent, comprehensive report. It organizes the information into meaningful sections and ensures the output is both thorough and readable.

## Features

- **Multi-source intelligence gathering**: Collects data from web searches, social media, and official feeds
- **Automated analysis**: AI-powered summarization and categorization
- **Persistent storage**: Maintains session history in PostgreSQL
- **Markdown formatting**: Clean, readable reports
- **Customizable focus**: Can be configured to focus on specific threat groups or broad overviews

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL database
- Agno framework and its dependencies (see requirements.txt)
- EXA API key (for web search capabilities)

## API Keys Setup

### EXA API Key
The tool uses EXA (a powerful search engine API that provides comprehensive web search capability) for web searches and threat intelligence gathering. You need to obtain an API key:

1. Sign up for an API key at [EXA's website](https://exa.ai)
2. Set up the API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export EXA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
Without a valid EXA API key, the web search functionality will not work, limiting the tool's ability to gather real-time threat intelligence.

### Gemini API Key
For the LLM functionality:
1. Obtain a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
2. Set as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Setup

1. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up PostgreSQL database:
   - Install PostgreSQL if not already installed
   - Create a database named 'agno'
   - The script uses your system username with no password for local development

3. Configure the script (optional):
   - Update database credentials if needed
   - Modify RSS feeds in the FEEDS dictionary
   - Adjust agent instructions for different focus areas

## Usage

Run the script to generate a comprehensive threat intelligence report:

```
python threat-intel.py
```

The script will activate all four AI agents, gather intelligence from multiple sources, and output a well-structured report with actionable insights.

## Customization

You can customize the threat intelligence focus by modifying the final prompt to the summary agent. For example:

```python
# For a general threat report
response = summary_agent.print_response(
    "Provide a threat intelligence report on recent cybersecurity threats",
    stream=False
)

# For a focused report on a specific threat actor
response = summary_agent.print_response(
    "Provide a threat intelligence report on recent cybersecurity threats, focusing on the Clop ransomware group.",
    stream=False
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Package Installation
If you get import errors related to `exa_py`, make sure to install it with:
```
pip install exa_py
```

### API Key Issues
If you see search-related errors, verify that:
- Your EXA API key is correctly set in the environment
- The API key is valid and has sufficient quota remaining

### PostgreSQL Connection Issues
If you encounter PostgreSQL connection errors:
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Verify the username, password, host, port, and database name
- Check if the PostgreSQL client libraries are installed
